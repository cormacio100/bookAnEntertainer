DONE:

-   Navbar responsiveness


-   -   GET ACCESS TO HEROKU DB
    -   I BELIEVE I HAVE THE IMAGE SETTINGS CORRECT NOW. NEED TO RESTART EVERYTHING
        -   THEN TRY TO UPLOAD IMAGES AGAIN AND TEST THE LINKS
        -   CHECK MODEL FILE IS CORRECT

-   NB
    WHen FS_PROFILE_IMG_UPLOADS = 'profile/' I can see when the app is run locally
    that it uploads files to /profile/ and /image1/ but not in the root folder

    If run on Heroku
        -   FS_PROFILE_IMG_UPLOADS = 'profile/' generates the link:
            -   https://bookanentertainer.s3.amazonaws.com/media/profile/800px-HankWilliams1951concert.jpg
        -   FS_PROFILE_IMG_UPLOADS = os.path.join(DEFAULT_FILE_STORAGE,'profile/')
            -   https://bookanentertainer.s3.amazonaws.com/media/custom_storages.MediaStorage/profile/Waylon_Jennings_RCA_cropped.jpg
        -   First one is more correct
        -   Both have models.py imageFields set to:
            -   upload_to = settings.FS_PROFILE_IMG_UPLOADS,
        -   NO FILE GENERATED ON AWS
